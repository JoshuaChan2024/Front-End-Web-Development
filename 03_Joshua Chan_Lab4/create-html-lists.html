        <h1>Types of Hot Coffee Drinks</h1>
        <dl>Black Coffee</dl>
            <dd>No frills here: Black coffee is made from plain ground coffee beans that are brewed hot. It's served without added sugar, milk or flavorings.</dd>
        <dl>Decaf</dl>
            <dd>Coffee beans naturally contain caffeine, but roasters can use several different processes to remove almost all of it. Decaf coffee is brewed with these decaffeinated beans.</dd>
        <dl>Espresso</dl>
            <dd>Most people know that a shot of espresso is stronger than the same amount of coffee, but what's the difference, exactly? There isn't anything inherently different about the beans themselves, but when beans are used to make espresso they're more finely ground, and they're brewed with a higher grounds-to-water ratio than what's used for coffee. The result is a thicker, more concentrated liquid with a bolder flavor. A single espresso is a one-ounce shot. It's also the base for popular coffee-shop drinks like lattes and cappuccinos.</dd>
        <dl>Latte</dl>
            <dd>This classic drink is typically 1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk, topped with a thin layer of foam, but coffee shops have come up with seemingly endless customizations. You can experiment with flavored syrups like vanilla and pumpkin spice or create a nondairy version by using oat milk. Skilled baristas often swirl the foam into latte art!</dd>
